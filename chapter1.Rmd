# My expectations 
On this course I hope to learn how to use R to produce statistical analysis for my PhD thesis. I hope R could be a tool to produce good figures as well. I have no previous experience in writing code, so I assume I need to work a lot on this course. I hearf of this course from my colleagues.#
